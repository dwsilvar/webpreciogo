# This file is responsible for interacting with Large Language Model (LLM) APIs.
# It handles sending processed text to the LLM and receiving raw responses.

# Basic imports for potential LLM provider SDKs (example using Google Generative AI)
# import google.generativeai as genai

# Add imports for other LLM providers as needed (e.g., for OpenAI)
# import openai

# Further functions and classes for LLM interaction will be added here.
